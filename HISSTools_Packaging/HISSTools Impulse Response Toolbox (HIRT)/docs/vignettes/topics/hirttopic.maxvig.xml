<br />
<b>Overview</b> <br />
<br />
<b>HIRT</b> (HISSTools Impulse Response Toolbox) is a set of tools for working with convolution and IRs (Impulse Responses) in Max. This set of objects addresses tasks such as measuring IRs, spectral display from realtime input/buffers, and non-realtime convolution, deconvolution and inversion, as well as realtime zero or low latency convolution. The objects are open source and BSD licensed: <br />

<br />
<br />
These tools enable the design of solutions to a number of specific issues, such as Loudspeaker and Room Correction, Close Acoustic Capture Correction (Microphone Correction), and Creative Applications of Convolution. The toolbox can be downloaded from the <b>Max Package Manager</b>. <br />
<br />
<b>HIRT</b> is by Alex Harker &amp; Pierre Alexandre Tremblay, <b>CeReNeM</b> at the <b>University of Huddersfield</b>, UK. <br />

<b>Concept</b> <br />
<br />
The first goal of the <b>HIRT</b> project is to allow for loudspeaker / room corrections to be generated and applied rapidly and efficiently for use in a concert environment. By extension, such corrections can also be employed in a studio setting. <br />
<br />
The second motivation for the <b>HIRT</b> is to improve the frequency balance of close microphone or pick-up capture. The idea is to take a close capture of an instrument that is relatively free from issues of spill and feedback, and improve the frequency balance prior to electronic processing, thus achieving better tonal balance. <br />
<br />
However, it was felt that creating these specific solutions would be both inflexible for the given tasks, and also limited in terms of re-application. Therefore a highly modular design has been implemented, suited to a large number of convolution and impulse response related problems. The <b>HIRT</b> is thus suitable for use in relation to several general problems, including multichannel IR measurement, multichannel convolution, FIR Design, crosstalk cancellation and convolution reverb. <br />
<br />
<b>The underlying technical approaches include</b>: <br />
<br />
FFT-based Processing <br />
Fast Deconvolution with Regularisation <br />
IR Measurement <br />
Frequency Smoothing <br />
Phase Alteration <br />
<br />
<b>The Max Package includes</b>: <br />
<br />
21 externals with full help file and reference documentation <br />
Various examples of use <br />
3 <m>hirt.*</m> abstractions for Reverb, Convolution and Impulse Response Authoring tasks <br />
