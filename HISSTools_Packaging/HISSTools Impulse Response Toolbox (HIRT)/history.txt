Change Log
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in 2.1

New Features

All externals on macOS platform now in UB2 format and operating on Intel and Apple Silicon
All externals are signed

Improvements

irvalue~: helpfile improved for clarity
Effect abstractions: now handle patcher zoom and float more elegantly
Effect abstractions: editing mode is now more obvious

Bug Fixes

spectrumdraw~: drawing issue with 'select' fixed
Effect abstractions: fixed damping to morphfilter~ for case of very short IRs
Effect abstractions: fixed @file attribute persistence in hirt.convolver~
Effect abstractions: fixed inline documentation for issues introduced in changes to Max [hover] object

-------

Changes in 2.0.1

Bug Fixes

Effect abstractions: fixed bug in custom UI dial where values could be sent in inactive mode under certain circumstances
Effect abstractions: fixed multiconvolve~ latency initialising in hirt.convolutionreverb~

-------

Changes in 2.0

New Features

Moved to Max Package format
New complete reference documentation and updated help files
New abstractions including Convolution Reverb effect

morphfilter~: new object for use in the hirt.convolutionreverb~ (for IR damping)
bufreverse~: new  object for use in the hirt.convolutionreverb~ (for IR reversal)
bufresample~: new  object for use in the hirt.convolutionreverb~ (for IR resampling)

All objects: can now access limitless channels of a buffer~

Improvements

iraverage~/irplapprox~/irreference:~ - Hi-Quality smoothing code is now significantly faster

Bug Fixes

iralign~/iraverage~/irinvert~/irnonlin~/irtrimnorm~: fixed bug with checking buffers when using multiple names
irextract~: fixed the use of coloured noise inputs to prevent hang
irextract~: fixed the amplitude of results, according to the parameter settings
irextract~: fixed error string when no contents present
irextract~/irmeasure~: added the irgain attribute for real-world IR measurements
irextract~/irmeasure~: fixed scaling with coloured noise measurements
irextract~/irmeasure~/irsweeps~: fixed bugs with amplitudes of outputs/deconvolution for sweeps
irextract~/irmeasure~/irsweeps~: fixed bug with results when no amplitude curve is set
irinvert~: fixed to allow source and receiver size mismatches in MIMO mode
irinvert~/irnonlin~: fixed a bug with complex division on windows that resulted in incorrect outputs
irstats~: fixed a minor bug with the onset detection code
irstats~: fixed bugs in the calculation of the center stat
irvalue~: corrected linear interpolation of values
multiconvolve~: fixed bugs with missing parts of an IR for block sizes of >= 256 
multiconvolve~: object now functions with block sizes < 4
spectrumdraw~: clipping of drawing has been corrected to fix a bug with incorrect appearance
spectrumdraw~: the ÔHannÕ window is now correctly named

All objects: buffer reading is now as documented when requesting a channel above the number in the buffer.

All objects (windows only): fixed code relating to deconvolution filters and amp specifiers

-------

Changes in 1.2

New Features

irvalue~: new object to return dB amplitude of IR at given frequency (Hz) input
irmeasure~: can now take up to 128 inputs & outputs


Bug Fixes

irmeasure~: fixed bug with progress reporting when measuring with less channels than present in the object.
irstats~: fixed bugs that prevented reporting center and t30 stats correctly

-------


Changes in 1.1

PLEASE NOTE

irmeasure~ has changed arguments. These are now num inputs / num outputs.
Whilst non-ideal to change argument ordering, this is more intuitive and matches multiconvolve~.

New Features

irextract~: new object to extract impulse responses from recorded sweeps
irextract~/irmeasure~/irsweeps~: added control over sweep amplitude against frequency

Bug Fixes

Multiple objects: time multiplier arguments now correct in all objects

irmeasure~: i/o args have been swapped 
irphase~ arguments are now safe
irtrimnorm~: message cropto now correctly outputs bang on success.
irtrimnorm: pad mode fades now correctly aligned in time
irtrimnorm~ pad arguments corrected
spectrumdraw~: crash with low frequency mousing
spectrumdraw~: notes are assigned incorrectly to octaves
